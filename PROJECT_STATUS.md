  - ‚úÖ Syntax parsing for CREATE, MATCH, WHERE, RETURN, etc.
  - ‚ùå Full execution of parsed queries
  - ‚ùå Property access in RETURN clauses
  - ‚ùå Complex WHERE conditions
  - ‚ùå Relationship pattern matching

### Advanced Cypher Features
- **Missing**: 
  - Path queries and variable-length relationships
  - Aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, etc.)
  - Advanced WHERE conditions (comparison operators, logical operations)
  - ORDER BY, LIMIT, SKIP implementation
  - MERGE operations
  - DELETE operations via Cypher

## üöÄ Architecture Highlights

### Design Patterns
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between graph operations, parsing, and transactions
- **Extensibility**: Modular design allows easy addition of new features
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception hierarchy
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints throughout the codebase

### Performance Considerations
- **igraph Backend**: Leverages optimized C library for graph operations
- **Packrat Parsing**: Enabled for better parsing performance
- **Memory Efficiency**: Efficient state capture for transactions

### Code Quality
- **Clean Code**: Well-structured, readable code with clear naming
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and examples
- **Testing**: High test coverage for implemented features
- **Standards**: Follows Python best practices and PEP standards
